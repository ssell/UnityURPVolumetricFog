# Volumetric Fog - Unity URP

![](Media/MountainFog.png)

This repository contains a demo of a custom volumetric fog implementation for the Universal Render Pipeline in Unity. It is accompanied by a tutorial article which covers both the fog shader and the custom render pass:

* [Rendering Volumetric Fog Using Custom URP Render Pass](httpS://www.vertexfragment.com/ramblings/urp-volumetric-fog/)

This demo was written against Unity v2023.2.1f1 and _may_ see updates in the future.

# Third-Party Assets

This demo makes use of the following free third-party assets:

* [Terrain Sample Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808)
* [Rock and Boulders 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-and-boulders-2-6947)

I would be remiss to not mention that the [Procedural Terrain Painter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/procedural-terrain-painter-188357) asset, though not present in the repository, was used to paint the mountain.
